# OnlinePollSubmission
How to use a Python script to enter in entries to an online poll.

Created this script for some friends to help them win an online contest for a school project. 

Some obsticles that I faced when trying to create this script that you may also run into are:
  + Time - selenium may run faster than your webbrowser.
  + Google reCAPTCHA - Google has limitations on automating the web and clicking submit.
  + Finding the element - you may have to try a few different ways to locate the element. In my script I used find_element_by_id.
                          Use this link for other ways to locate the element. (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html)
